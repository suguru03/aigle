Aigle
--

[Work In Progress]

Aigle is an ideal promise library.
Aigle is never slow down even if you mix different Aigle versions and other promise libraries.
All Aigle class is extended by same [Aigle-Core](https://github.com/suguru03/aigle-core). [benchmark](https://github.com/suguru03/aigle-benchmark)

Also Aigle has a lot of [async](https://github.com/caolan/async) functions, you can start to use `Promise` easily.

Let's stop using Async, let's start to use Aigle.
